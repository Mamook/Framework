To minify CSS:
	1. Drop the file (or multiple files if they are to be concatenated together) into the "css" folder.
	2. Run the minifyCSS.xml file with Ant.

		Command line example: ant -f {PATH_TO_BUILD_XML}/minifyCSS.xml

		This will create two files in the "minified" folder; an unmimified concatenated version of the file(s) in the "css" folder called style.big.css and a minified concatenated version of the file(s) in the "css" folder called style.css. Rename these files as you wish and remove them from the "minified" folder for use in the site.
	3. Remove the original CSS files from the "css" folder (or they will get built into the next batch of files that gets dropped in there.)

To minify JavaScript:
	1. Drop the file (or multiple files if they are to be concatenated together) into the "js" folder.
	2. Run the minifyJS.xml file with Ant.

		Command line example: ant -f {PATH_TO_BUILD_XML}/minifyJS.xml

		This will create two files in the "minified" folder; an unmimified concatenated version of the file(s) in the "js" folder called script.big.js and a minified concatenated version of the file(s) in the "js" folder called script.js. Rename these files as you wish and remove them from the "minified" folder for use in the site.
	3. Remove the original JavaScript files from the "js" folder (or they will get built into the next batch of files that gets dropped in there.)
